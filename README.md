# Bootstrap
Week 10 CIT 31200
This webpage showcases Bootstrap's CSS tools for responsive web design. In the top row container, I used col-lg-3, col-lg-6, and col-lg-3 for large screens, emphasizing the main meal in the center. For smaller desktop screens, I applied a col-md-4 layout to ensure a balanced distribution of space. On screens smaller than 768px, the columns take up 100% of the row width, stacking for better readability and usability. In the bottom row, which features special recipes, I used col-lg-6 for both columns to maintain balance, preventing one recipe from overshadowing the other. For smaller screens, I applied col-md-12 to allocate more space to each recipe.
